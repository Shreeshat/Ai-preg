                <h2>Taking Care of Yourself During Pregnancy</h2>
                <p>Pregnancy is a beautiful and challenging journey that requires special attention to physical and mental well-being. Whether you are in the first or third trimester, self-care is essential to ensure a healthy pregnancy for both you and your baby.</p>

                    <p>The nutritional needs during pregnancy are different from those of non-pregnant women. A pregnant woman must eat nutrient-rich and pregnancy-safe food for the proper development of the fetus. It is best to consult an experienced dietician to get a customized diet plan.</p>
